My greatest drive has always been creativity and connection. Initially, I followed these interests through social services doing family unification work then as a counsellor in severe behavior schools. As my focus shifted, I completed a degree education, working as a primary school teacher in east London for five years and most recently as an online ESL teacher travelling the world for two more. 

Since September 2019, I have been studying at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development through creating. My experience at Makers Academy has instilled in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.

## Skills

#### Listening and Communication

My prior years of experience as a social services worker and then as a primary school teacher helped to develop my listening and communication skills, including identifying and articulating the needs and desired results of management (or the client) as well as clearly communicating progress, outcomes and areas in need of further analysis or development.

#### Outcome Driven

Both social services and teaching require the ability stay focused on outcomes, using skills such as self-monitoring for progress and thinking critically about areas in my work that can be developed or improved for efficiency and quality.
