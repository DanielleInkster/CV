## Profile

My greatest passions have always been creativity and community. Initially, I followed these interests through social services, then primary education and eventually to software development. I attended Makers Academy, an intensive software development course in London with curriculum is founded in Agile practices. My previous careers provided me with skills to work independently and as part of a cross-functional team. They also helped me to develop a high level of emotional intelligence for understanding users, strong written and oral communication skills to connect with peers, management and clients, as well as an outcome-driven mindset to deliver high-quality code in a timely manner. I have a good working knowledge of JavaScript and React, as well as Ruby and the Rails framework. I am a quick study and always looking to learn more.

## Personal Skills

#### Outcome Driven

Both social services and teaching require the ability stay focused on outcomes, using skills such as self-monitoring for progress and thinking critically about areas in my work that can be developed or improved for efficiency and quality. I've found this skill invaluable to my coding journey as it helps me to identify the intended outcomes of my projects and use my TDD skills and knowledge of OOP and SRP to create efficient and effective code.

#### Listening and Communication

My prior years of experience as a social services worker and then as a primary school teacher helped to develop my listening and communication skills, including identifying and articulating the needs and desired results of management (or the client) as well as clearly communicating progress, outcomes and areas in need of further analysis or development. In coding, these skills lend themselves well to working in pairs or as part of team to create a unified vision for a project and troubleshoot problems quickly and effectively. 

#### Team Player

My previous roles required working as part of a team in order to best meet the interests of each child in my care. This included liaising with a variety of different people such as management, doctors, social workers and psychologists as well as other frontline staff, both face to face and in writing and working collaboratively to achieve our intended outcomes. Additionally, this role has given me a lot of experience in both giving and receiving feedback, positive and negative, in order to improve our process to meet our intended outcomes. These skills translate well to coding when pairing or working as part of a team to efficiently create a well-designed project. 

#### Creative Problem Solver and Resilient

Working with students with a variety of abilities and needs, particularly severe behaviour students, requires the ability to quickly analyse a situation, often under pressure, and come up with a variety of solutions. I've found this to be a very useful skill in my coding journey as it has instilled within me the importance of thinking outside of the box, but also the resilience to persist should the first (or the first several) solutions not prove to be ideal.
