## Personal_Skills

#### Outcome Driven

Both social services and teaching require the ability to stay focused on outcomes, using skills such as self-monitoring for progress and thinking critically about areas in my work that can be developed or improved for efficiency and quality. I've found this skill invaluable to my coding journey as it helps me to identify the intended outcomes of my projects and use my TDD skills and knowledge of OOP and SRP to create efficient and effective code.

#### Listening and Communication

My prior years of experience as a social services worker and then as a primary school teacher helped to develop my listening and communication skills, including identifying and articulating the needs and desired results of management (or the client) as well as communicating progress, outcomes, and areas in need of further analysis or development. In coding, these skills lend themselves well to working in pairs or as part of a team to create a unified vision for a project and troubleshoot problems quickly and effectively. 

#### Creative Problem Solver and Resilient

Working with students with a variety of abilities and needs, particularly severe behavior students, requires the ability to quickly analyze a situation, often under pressure, and come up with a variety of solutions. I've found this to be a very useful skill in my coding journey as it has instilled within me the importance of thinking outside of the box, but also the resilience to persist should the first (or the first several) solutions not prove to be ideal.
